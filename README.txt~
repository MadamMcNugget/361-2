Right Click Menu

        A menu will appear when you right-click the game window.  Here is what 
these options do:

Restart - restarts the game

Skip to level - You have a choice of skipping to level 1, 3, 5, or 7. When 
chosen, the game will restart.

Disable/Enable row deletion - When enabled, each row that is full will be 
deleted, and the above tiles will shift down. This makes the game harder to 
lose.

Disable/Enable falling tiles - When disabled, tiles will stay as tetris shapes 
when settled, rather than falling as individual tiles if there is room 
underneath. This mode will leave many floating tiles. 

Quit - exits game


Bugs

Restarting - tiles fall faster with each restart

Rotate and Shuffle Tiles - If you shuffle, then rotate a tile, colour 
orientation of the tile will go back to the original unshuffled position.
