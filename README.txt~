Right Click Menu

        A menu will appear when you right-click the game window.  Here is what 
these options do:

Restart - restarts the game

Disable/Enable row deletion - When enabled, each row that is full will be 
deleted, and the above tiles will shift down. This makes the game harder to 
lose.

Disable/Enable falling tiles - When disabled, tiles will stay as tetris shapes 
when settled, rather than falling as individual tiles if there is room 
underneath. This mode will leave many floating tiles. 

Quit - exits game


Bugs

Tiles - first two tile are always the same
